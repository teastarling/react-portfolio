        <p className="content-text">After spending the last 10 years in New York City working with everything from snow leopards to sea lions, this Georgia girl has come home to do what it takes to chase the dream of becoming a Software Developer. Having recently earned a certificate in Full-Stack Development from Georgia Tech University, I am keen to utilize freshly minted skills in Javascript, Node.js, CSS, and HTML5 along with many years of strong team-oriented and problem-solving skills to translate team, client, and company needs into actionable objectives. My aim is to find the simplest path to reach the highest user satisfaction possible for each project while meeting client requisites. I am eager to apply my skills to new challenges as a team member within a fast-paced environment in order to reach both personal and company-wide goals.</p>
